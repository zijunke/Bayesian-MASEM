# Bayesian-MASEM
Bayesian MASEM that allows between-studies heterogeneity in SEM parameters

Four examples are provided illustrating how to apply the Bayesian MASEM approach to synthesizing SEM results from multiple studies. Missing correlations are allowed. The approach can provide model fit evaluation and perform model comparison. Continuous moderators are also allowed.
